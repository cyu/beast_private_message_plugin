INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

1) Install this plugin:

     cd vendor/beast
     svn export http://svn.codeeg.com/beast/private_message

2) Run the following command:

     script/runner 'Beast::Plugins::PrivateMessage.install'

3) Add the plugin to the list of Beast plugins to be initialized.  If you this is
   the first Beast plugin you can initialize plugins by creating a plugins.rb file
   in config/initializers and add the following line(s):
   
     Beast::Plugin.initialize_plugins 'Beast::Plugins::PrivateMessage'

4) Edit app/views/users/show.html.erb and add the following lines at the bottom:

     <%= private_messages @user %>
     <%= private_message_for @user %>

   The first method, 'private_messages', lists the private messages between the
   session user and the passed in user.  If the passed in user is the same as
   the session user, then all private messages involving that user is listed.
   The second method, 'private_message_for', generates the private message form
   on that page and a link to show that form.
